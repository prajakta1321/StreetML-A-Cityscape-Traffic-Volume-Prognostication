 StreetML: Cityscape Traffic Volume Prognostication

## ðŸŽ¯  Project Overview
A regression-based machine learning project focused on predicting urban traffic volumes using ensemble learning techniques. Currently in development as part of The Great Indian Hiring Hackathon 2024.

## âœ… Current Implementation:
âœ” Model Evaluation

âœ” Regression problem targeting traffic volume prediction

âœ” Model performance evaluated using RÂ² (R-squared) value

âœ” RÂ² metric chosen to determine goodness of fit and prediction accuracy

âœ” Higher RÂ² values indicate better model performance
